# CropRecommender

## Overview
CropRecommender is a machine learning-based crop recommendation system designed to help farmers and agricultural stakeholders predict suitable crops based on various soil and environmental parameters. This system utilizes a dataset containing essential agricultural features to provide accurate crop recommendations, enhancing productivity and informed decision-making in farming.

## Features
- Predicts suitable crops based on soil nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) and environmental conditions (Temperature, Humidity, pH, Rainfall).
- Utilizes various machine learning algorithms for accurate predictions.
- Provides insights into the relationships between different agricultural parameters through correlation analysis.

## Dataset
The project uses the **Crop_recommendation.csv** dataset, which includes:
- **N**: Nitrogen content in the soil
- **P**: Phosphorus content in the soil
- **K**: Potassium content in the soil
- **Temperature**: Average temperature (Â°C)
- **Humidity**: Average humidity (%)
- **pH**: Soil pH level
- **Rainfall**: Average rainfall (mm)
- **Label**: Recommended crop type
